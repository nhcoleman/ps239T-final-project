## Short Description

	For my final project I downloaded a selectiong of New York Times articles on three contemporary whistleblowers/leakers from LexisNexis. Python was used for data collection and R for preprocessing and analysis. I installed the dplyr, plyr, ggplot2 and venn-diagram packages to complete these tasks. I determined the number of articles on each in the dataset, overlap of coverage, and coverage of each over time and created visualizations. 
	

## Dependencies

For my project I used the following programs:

Python 2.7.10 :: Anaconda 2.3.0 (64 bit)
Rx64 3.2.2

(full terms of use appear in data folder)

### Code

1. 01_Collect-NYT_Final.ipynb: Collects five text files from LexisNexis and exports data to five CSV files.
2.02_Clean_Categorize_Merge_Data_Final: Loads, cleans, and merges the five raw datasets into the final dataset.
2. 03_Analysis_Final: Conducts descriptive analysis of the data, producing the visualizations (graphs and venn diagram) found in the Results directory.

### Results

1. 01-articles-over-time.png: Graphs the number of articles about each person over time.
2. 02-articles-per-person.png: Bar graph shows the number of articles by person in the dataset.  
3. 03-coverage-overlap-venn-diagram.tiff: Venn diagram shows the overlap in coverage by person in the dataset.
